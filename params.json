This project uses nothing but good ol' div's for all the objects and graphics, will scale perfectly on almost any screen (mobile and desktop), is terribly unoptimized, laggy, and isn't nearly as fast as it would've been if I had just used a canvas instead. But here it is!\r\n\r\nLive App\r\n------------\r\nCheck out a live preview of it over here:\r\nhttp://nebez.github.io/floppybird/\r\n\r\nCool Stuff\r\n---------\r\n*Some cool things other people have done with the code. Let me know about your projects and I'll link it here*\r\nhttps://github.com/rukmal/FlappyLeapBird - **[Rukmal](http://rukmal.me/)** integrated LeapMotion Controller functionality! Check out his website, he's done some cool stuff.\r\nhttp://chrisbeaumont.github.io/floppybird/ - **[@chrisbeaumont](https://github.com/chrisbeaumont)** made an awesome auto-pilot, check it out\r\nhttp://www.lobe.io/flappy-math-saga/- **[@tikwid](https://github.com/tikwid)** made a really cool version designed to teach you times tables. really cool.\r\nhttp://dota2.cyborgmatt.com/flappydota/ - flappy dota, this one is really cool.\r\nhttp://tippy.gochiusa.net/ - Japanese anime inspired floppybird.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n------\r\n**[@aregowe](https://github.com/aregowe)** for optimizing all the assets\r\n\r\nNotice\r\n=====\r\nThe assets powering the visual element of the game have all been extracted directly from the Flappy Bird android game. I have only done the coding, not designed the visual elements.\r\nI do not own the assets, nor do I have explicit permission to use them from their creator. They are the work and copyright of original creator Dong Nguyen and .GEARS games (http://www.dotgears.com/).\r\nI took this Tweet (https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/431060041009856512 / http://i.imgur.com/AcyWyqf.png) by Dong Nguyen, the creator of the game, as an open invitation to reuse the game concept and assets in an open source project. There is no ill intention to steal the game, or claim it as my own. This is merely a recreation for fun.\r\nIf the copyright holder would like for the assets to be removed, let me know!\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=====\r\nCopyright 2014 Nebez Briefkani\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
